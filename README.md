# NeuralNetwork
Credit to Michael Nielsen and his ebook (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), from which the concepts used in my code (network.py) were built upon and for supplying the the file mnist_reader.py, used to read the MNIST data used to train and test the neural network. NB: The file network.py expects to find a directory called 'output' in the same location that it is hosted in.
